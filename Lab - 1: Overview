## **Lab Overview and Task Breakdown**  

This lab focuses on **AWS Systems Manager** and **AWS Config** to audit and manage AWS resources, particularly EC2 instances. 
You will set up inventory tracking, log in to instances securely, audit compliance with AWS Config, and review collected metadata.  

---

### **Lab Objectives**  
By the end of the lab, you should be able to:  
âœ… Set up **AWS Systems Manager Inventory** for an AWS infrastructure.  
âœ… Use **AWS Systems Manager** to securely log into Amazon EC2 instances.  
âœ… Configure **AWS Config** to audit AWS resources for compliance.  
âœ… Use **AWS Systems Manager Inventory** to view metadata on managed instances.  

---

## **Task Breakdown and Analysis**  

### **Task 1: Set Up AWS Systems Manager Inventory**  
âœ… Purpose: To **track metadata** (OS version, installed apps, etc.) on EC2 instances.  

**Steps:**  
1. Open **AWS Systems Manager** â†’ Navigate to **Inventory** â†’ Click **Setup Inventory**.  
2. Choose **Manually selecting instances** â†’ Select **Web Server** and **App Server** instances.  
3. Click **Setup Inventory**.  
4. Expected Output: A **green success banner** confirming inventory setup.  

**Key Insights:**  
- SSM Agent **must be installed** on the instances (Amazon Linux 2 has it pre-installed).  
- IAM permissions are required for both **the user** and **EC2 instances**.  

---

### **Task 2: Log into an Amazon EC2 Instance with AWS Systems Manager Session Manager**  
âœ… Purpose: To **securely access an EC2 instance** without SSH (no port 22 needed).  

**Steps:**  
1. Open **Systems Manager** â†’ Navigate to **Fleet Manager**.  
2. Click on the **Web Server instance ID**.  
3. Select **Connect > Start terminal session**.  
4. Run the following commands:  

   ```sh
   netstat -a | grep http  # List active HTTP connections
   ```

   ```sh
   TOKEN=`curl -X PUT "http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token" -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds: 21600"`
   AZ=`curl -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" -v http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/placement/availability-zone`
   export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=${AZ::-1}
   aws ec2 describe-instances
   ```

5. **Terminate the session** â†’ Close the browser tab.  

**Key Insights:**  
- **No need for SSH keys** â†’ AWS Session Manager is **more secure**.  
- **AWS CloudTrail** can log all session activity.  

---

### **Task 3: Enable AWS Config & Create a Compliance Rule**  
âœ… Purpose: To audit EC2 instances and check if they are **managed by AWS Systems Manager**.  

**Steps:**  
1. Open **AWS Config** â†’ Click **Get Started**.  
2. Choose:  
   - **All resource types with customizable overrides**.  
   - **Continuous recording**.  
   - **Create AWS Config service-linked role** (or use an existing one).  
3. Click **Next** â†’ Search for rule **ec2-instance-managed-by-systems-manager**.  
4. Select the rule â†’ Click **Next** â†’ **Confirm** setup.  
5. AWS Config will scan EC2 instances and **evaluate compliance**.  

**Key Insights:**  
- **AWS Config continuously records changes** in resource configurations.  
- EC2 instances should eventually show as **Compliant** (takes a few minutes).  

---

### **Task 4: Audit IAM User Permissions with AWS Config**  
âœ… Purpose: To check for **IAM users with inline policies** (not recommended for security).  

**Steps:**  
1. Go to **AWS Config** â†’ Select **Rules** â†’ Click **Add Rule**.  
2. Search for **iam-user-no-policies-check**.  
3. Select the rule â†’ Click **Next** â†’ Accept defaults â†’ Click **Save**.  
4. AWS Config scans IAM users and **flags inline policies**.  

**Key Insights:**  
- **Inline policies are risky** because they are user-specific (use managed policies instead).  
- Compliance status will likely show **Non-Compliant**, but no remediation is required in this lab.

### **Task 5: Explore Systems Manager Inventory Data**  
âœ… Purpose: To view metadata collected from EC2 instances.  

**Steps:**  
1. Open **AWS Systems Manager** â†’ Go to **Inventory**.  
2. Check the **Top 5 Applications** installed on managed EC2 instances.  
3. Select an **instance ID** â†’ View:  
   - **General section**: IP address, SSH key, instance type.  
   - **Tags section**: Associated tags.  
   - **Inventory section**: Search for `bind-utils` package.  
   - **Associations section**: Last SSM document executed.  
   - **Patches section**: Installed patches.  

**Key Insights:**  
- Systems Manager **centralizes inventory data** for all managed instances.  
- This is useful for **tracking installed software, patches, and security compliance**.  

---

## **Final Notes and Key Takeaways**  
- **AWS Systems Manager** simplifies EC2 management by allowing **secure access, inventory tracking, and fleet management**.  
- **AWS Config** continuously **monitors AWS resources** and ensures **compliance**.  
- **Session Manager replaces SSH** for secure, auditable EC2 access.  
- **IAM inline policies should be avoided**â€”use **managed policies** instead.  
- **Data synchronization delays are expected** in AWS Config; refresh periodically.
