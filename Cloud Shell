# **🔷 AWS CloudShell – A Fully Managed Command Line Interface (CLI) in AWS**  

## **📌 What is AWS CloudShell?**  
AWS **CloudShell** is a **browser-based command-line interface (CLI)** that provides an **instant Linux shell** for interacting with AWS services. 
It comes **pre-installed with AWS CLI, Python, Node.js, and other development tools**, 
allowing users to execute AWS commands **without needing to install CLI tools on their local machines**.

✅ **Pre-authenticated AWS CLI** (No need to configure credentials)  
✅ **No Setup Required** (Runs instantly in the AWS Management Console)  
✅ **Persistent Home Directory (1 GB storage per region)**  
✅ **Secure & Private (Runs in a temporary environment per session)**  
✅ **Supports Multiple AWS Regions**

## **1️⃣ AWS CloudShell Features & Benefits**
### **🔹 Key Features**
✔️ **Pre-installed AWS CLI & Tools** – No need to install anything locally.  
✔️ **Secure & IAM-Managed** – Uses IAM permissions for authentication.  
✔️ **Persistent Storage** – Stores **up to 1 GB** per region.  
✔️ **Supports Multiple Programming Languages** – Comes with **Python, Node.js, Bash, and PowerShell**.  
✔️ **Access to AWS Services** – Use it to interact with **EC2, S3, Lambda, and more**.  

### **🔹 Benefits**
| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| **No Local Installation** | Works in the AWS Console; no need to install AWS CLI. |
| **Pre-authenticated** | Automatically uses IAM permissions; no manual credential setup. |
| **Multi-Region Access** | Can operate in different AWS regions. |
| **Persistent Storage** | 1 GB home directory per region (retained between sessions). |
| **Secure Environment** | Temporary session-based shell with IAM-based access control. |

## **2️⃣ How to Access AWS CloudShell?**
### **🔹 Opening CloudShell in AWS Console**
1️⃣ **Sign in** to your **AWS Management Console**.  
2️⃣ Click the **CloudShell icon** (🔳) in the top-right navigation bar.  
3️⃣ CloudShell **opens in a new terminal window** within the AWS console.  

### **🔹 Starting CloudShell via CLI**
You can launch AWS CloudShell directly using the AWS CLI:
```bash
aws cloudshell create-session
```

---

## **3️⃣ CloudShell vs. AWS CLI vs. EC2 Bastion**
| Feature | AWS CloudShell | AWS CLI (Local) | EC2 Bastion Host |
|---------|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Setup** | No setup required | Requires installation | Requires EC2 setup |
| **Authentication** | Pre-authenticated | Requires manual credential setup | Requires SSH keys |
| **Security** | IAM-based access | IAM or credential file | SSH/RDP (less secure) |
| **Persistence** | 1 GB storage per region | Depends on local setup | Persistent (as long as EC2 runs) |
| **Cost** | Free | Free | EC2 instance cost applies |
| **Best For** | Quick AWS CLI access | Advanced local scripting | Private network access |

---

## **4️⃣ CloudShell Usage: Common AWS CLI Commands**
### **🔹 Check AWS Identity**
```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
```
🔹 Returns IAM role details for the current session.

### **🔹 List S3 Buckets**
```bash
aws s3 ls
```
🔹 Shows all S3 buckets in the current AWS account.

### **🔹 Start an EC2 Instance**
```bash
aws ec2 start-instances --instance-ids i-0abcdef1234567890
```

### **🔹 Stop an EC2 Instance**
```bash
aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids i-0abcdef1234567890
```

### **🔹 Check Available EC2 Instances**
```bash
aws ec2 describe-instances --query "Reservations[*].Instances[*].[InstanceId,State.Name,PublicIpAddress]"
```

---

## **5️⃣ CloudShell Persistent Storage**
🔹 **Each AWS region gets 1 GB of persistent storage** (`/home/cloudshell-user`).  
🔹 Files stored in **one region are not accessible in another**.  
🔹 **Storage is automatically mounted between sessions**.  

### **🔹 Checking Disk Space**
```bash
df -h
```

### **🔹 Saving Files**
```bash
echo "Hello, AWS CloudShell!" > myfile.txt
```

### **🔹 Downloading Files**
To download a file from CloudShell to your local machine:  
1️⃣ Click the **"Actions"** menu (top-right).  
2️⃣ Select **"Download file"** and enter the filename.  

---

## **6️⃣ Security & IAM Permissions for CloudShell**
### **🔹 CloudShell Uses IAM Roles & Permissions**
✔️ **Follows IAM security policies** assigned to the AWS user.  
✔️ Users can **only execute commands** that their IAM permissions allow.  
✔️ Supports **AWS Organizations** to restrict access.  

### **🔹 Restricting CloudShell Access (Example IAM Policy)**
To **block CloudShell access**, attach this policy to a user or role:
```json
{
    "Effect": "Deny",
    "Action": "cloudshell:*",
    "Resource": "*"
}
```

---

## **7️⃣ CloudShell Advanced Features**
### **🔹 Port Forwarding**
✔️ Forward ports to interact with applications running inside AWS CloudShell.  

### **🔹 Cross-Platform Support**
✔️ Works on **Windows, Linux, macOS** through a browser.  

### **🔹 Multi-Region Access**
✔️ Can be used across **different AWS regions**, but storage is region-specific.
