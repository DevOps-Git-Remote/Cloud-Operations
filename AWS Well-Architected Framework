🔹 **Focus:** Automate and monitor operations to improve efficiency and reliability.  
🔹 **Best Practices:**  
✔️ Automate infrastructure deployment (**AWS CloudFormation, AWS Systems Manager**)  
✔️ Enable real-time monitoring and logging (**Amazon CloudWatch, AWS X-Ray**)  
✔️ Use Infrastructure as Code (**IaC**) for consistent deployment  

🔹 **Key AWS Services:**  
✅ AWS CloudFormation  
✅ AWS Systems Manager  
✅ Amazon CloudWatch  

---

### **2️⃣ Security 🔐**  
🔹 **Focus:** Protect information, systems, and assets while ensuring compliance.  
🔹 **Best Practices:**  
✔️ Implement least privilege access (**AWS IAM, AWS Organizations**)  
✔️ Encrypt data at rest and in transit (**AWS KMS, AWS Secrets Manager**)  
✔️ Continuously monitor for threats (**AWS GuardDuty, AWS Security Hub**)  

🔹 **Key AWS Services:**  
✅ AWS IAM (Identity & Access Management)  
✅ AWS Shield & WAF (DDoS & Web Protection)  
✅ AWS GuardDuty & Security Hub  

---

### **3️⃣ Reliability 🔄**  
🔹 **Focus:** Ensure workloads recover quickly from failures and scale effectively.  
🔹 **Best Practices:**  
✔️ Use **Auto Scaling** to handle workload fluctuations  
✔️ Design for **fault tolerance** with Multi-AZ & Multi-Region architecture  
✔️ Implement **disaster recovery** strategies (Backup, Replication, Failover)  

🔹 **Key AWS Services:**  
✅ AWS Auto Scaling  
✅ AWS Backup & Disaster Recovery  
✅ AWS Route 53 (DNS failover)  

---

### **4️⃣ Performance Efficiency ⚡**  
🔹 **Focus:** Use resources efficiently to meet system requirements.  
🔹 **Best Practices:**  
✔️ Use the right compute services (**EC2, Lambda, ECS, EKS**)  
✔️ Optimize databases (**Amazon RDS, DynamoDB**)  
✔️ Implement caching solutions (**Amazon CloudFront, ElastiCache**)  

🔹 **Key AWS Services:**  
✅ Amazon EC2, Lambda, ECS, EKS  
✅ Amazon RDS & DynamoDB  
✅ Amazon CloudFront & ElastiCache  

---

### **5️⃣ Cost Optimization 💰**  
🔹 **Focus:** Manage costs while delivering business value.  
🔹 **Best Practices:**  
✔️ Use **AWS Cost Explorer & Budgets** to track spending  
✔️ Use **Spot Instances & Reserved Instances** for savings  
✔️ Implement **Auto Scaling** to adjust resources based on demand  

🔹 **Key AWS Services:**  
✅ AWS Cost Explorer & Budgets  
✅ AWS Compute Optimizer  
✅ AWS Auto Scaling & Spot Instances  

---

### **6️⃣ Sustainability 🌍**  
🔹 **Focus:** Minimize environmental impact while optimizing resource usage.  
🔹 **Best Practices:**  
✔️ Optimize workloads to reduce energy consumption  
✔️ Use AWS **Graviton** processors for energy efficiency  
✔️ Choose AWS **Regions** with lower carbon footprints  

🔹 **Key AWS Services:**  
✅ AWS Graviton-based EC2 Instances  
✅ AWS Auto Scaling (to avoid over-provisioning)  
✅ AWS Trusted Advisor (efficiency recommendations)
