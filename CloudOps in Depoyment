Now that you understand **CloudOps in Deployment**, let's move to **"Developing a Tagging Strategy"** for resource management. 🚀

### **📌 CloudOps in Deployment: Deployment Must Adhere to Best Practices**  

For a successful and efficient deployment, CloudOps must follow **best practices** to ensure scalability, security, reliability, and cost-effectiveness. Deployments must adhere to the following principles:  

---

## **1️⃣ Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Compliance**  
✅ **Why?** Ensures consistent, repeatable, and automated deployments.  

🔹 Use **AWS CloudFormation, Terraform, or AWS CDK** to define infrastructure as code.  
🔹 Ensure **all deployments are version-controlled** in Git repositories.  
🔹 Implement **parameterized templates** to avoid hardcoded values.  
🔹 Use **CloudFormation StackSets** for deploying resources across multiple AWS accounts.  

**Example:** Deploying an **EC2 instance with a security group** using CloudFormation instead of manual setup.
