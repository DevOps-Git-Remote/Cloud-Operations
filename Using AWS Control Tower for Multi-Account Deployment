## **📌 How AWS Control Tower Works for Multi-Account Deployment?**  

### **Step 1️⃣: Set Up AWS Control Tower**  
1️⃣ **Go to AWS Console** → Open **AWS Control Tower**.  
2️⃣ **Enable AWS Organizations** if not already set up.  
3️⃣ Deploy the **Landing Zone** (AWS sets up accounts, networking, security, and policies).  

### **Step 2️⃣: Define Organizational Units (OUs)**  
- **OUs group related AWS accounts together** (e.g., Development, Testing, Production).  
- Apply **security policies** at the **OU level** instead of managing each account separately.  

### **Step 3️⃣: Configure Guardrails for Security & Compliance**  
- **Enable preventive guardrails** to block misconfigurations (e.g., disable public S3 buckets).  
- **Enable detective guardrails** to track unauthorized activity.  

### **Step 4️⃣: Use Account Factory to Create AWS Accounts**  
1️⃣ Navigate to **Control Tower → Account Factory**.  
2️⃣ Click **Create Account** and fill in details (e.g., account name, email, OU).  
3️⃣ AWS **automatically provisions the new account** with security policies applied.  

### **Step 5️⃣: Monitor & Audit Multi-Account Environment**  
- Use **AWS CloudTrail** and **AWS Config** to track activities and changes.  
- View compliance status in **AWS Security Hub**.

| **Workloads OU**  | Production Applications | Business-critical applications |  
| **Shared Services OU**  | Networking, Logging, Monitoring | Common services used by all accounts |  

---

## **📌 Best Practices for AWS Control Tower**  

✅ **Use Organizational Units (OUs) Effectively** – Group accounts based on function (e.g., Security, Dev, Production).  
✅ **Apply Guardrails Early** – Prevent security misconfigurations from the start.  
✅ **Automate Account Creation** – Use **Account Factory** to create accounts faster.  
✅ **Monitor with AWS Security Hub** – Regularly check security findings across accounts.  
✅ **Use Centralized Billing** – Consolidate AWS costs using **AWS Organizations**.
