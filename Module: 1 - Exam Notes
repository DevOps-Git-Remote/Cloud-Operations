Cloud Operations:

Definition:
  Cloud Ops refers to managing, monitoring, automating and optimizing cloud-based infrastructure, applications, and services. 
  It ensures cloud environments run securely, efficiently, and reliably with Minimal Downtime.
Key Aspects:
1. Monitoring and Observability -> Ensure applications and infrastructure are performing as expected.
2. Automation and Deployment -> Automate cloud infrastructure and reduce manual effort
3. Security & Compliance -> Protect cloud workloads and enforce security best practices.
4. Networking & Connectivity -> Ensure secure and efficient cloud networking.
5. Reliability & Business Continuity -> Keep service available, back-up and disaster-ready
6. Cost Optimization & Performance efficiency -> Optimize AWS resources for cost and performance.

Why CloudOps?
1. Minimize downtime
2. Enhance Security
3. Improves Scalability
4. Reduce Operational Costs.
5. Ensures Disaster Recovery.

What are Cloud Operations?
  1. Deploy -> Deploy applications and Infrastructure efficiently. -> Cloud Formation, Elastic Beanstalk, Code Deploy & ECS, EKS
  2. Monitor -> Detect issues before they impact the user. -> CloudWatch, X-Ray, Config & Cloud Trail
  3. Fortify -> Protect workloads and enforce security policies. -> IAM, GuardDuty(Threat Detection), WAF & Sheild, Security Hub
  4. Sustain -> Ensures continuous operations with minimal downtime. -> Auto Scaling, Backup, Route 53 & Disaster Recovery
  5. Secure -> Control access and safeguard data -> IAM, KMS, Secrets manager, Private Link
  6. Optimize -> Reduce costs and improve efficiency -> Trusted Advisor, Cost Explorer & Budgets, Compute Optimizer, Auto Scaling & Spot Instances.

AWS Well-Architected Framework:
  It provides best practices to help cloud architects "build secure, high-performing, resillient, and efficient" cloud infrastructure. 
  It is based on "6 Key Pillars" that guide the design and operation of AWS workloads.
    1. Operational Excellence -> Automate and Monitor operations to improve efficiency and reliability.
    2. Security -> Protect Information, systems, and assets while ensuring compliance.
    3. Reliability -> Ensure workloads recover quickly from failures and scale effectively
    4. Performance Efficiency -> Use resources efficiently to meet system requirements.
    5. Cost Optimization -> Manage costs while delivering business value.
    6. Sustainability -> Minimize environmental impact while optimizing resource usage.
  Why?
    1. Build Resilient & Secure Application
    2. Ensure Compliance & Best Practices
    3. Optimize costs & Performance
    4. Scale Applications Efficiently
  General Design Principles:
    1. Stop Guessing Capacity Needs
    2. Test Systems at production Scale
    3. Automate to Reduce Manual Effort

      5. Performance

Operational Excellence Principles:
  It focuses on running workloads effectively, continuously improving processes, and delivering business value.
  Key Principles:
    1. Proform Operations as code -> Manual processes lead to errors and inefficiencies. -> Use IaC & Automate Operational tasks
    2. Make Frequent, Small, Reversible Changes -> Large Updates increase risk and downtime -> Use CI/CD Pipelines & Small changes to reverse easily
    3. Refine Operations Procedures Frequently -> Outdated procedures slow down the issue resolution -> Use runbooks & Incident response plans, Automate testing for procedures.
    4. Anticipate Failure & Design for Resilience -> Single point of failure cause major downtime -< Use Multi-AZ
    5. Learn from Operational Failures -> Repeating the same mistakes due to lack of analysis. -> COnduct Post Incident Analysis, AWS Monitoring tools.
  Best Practices:
    1. Prepare: Before deploying workloads, ensure our operational priorities, design, evolve, and readiness are well-defined.
        Operational Priorities -> Define Clear business and operational Goals -> Align with SLAs, recovery objectives and performance expectations, Implement Decision making framework for handling operational issues.
